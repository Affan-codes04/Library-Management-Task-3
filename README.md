# 📚 Java Library Management System

Welcome to my **Java Console-based Library Management System**, built as part of my internship at **Elevate Labs**.  
This project showcases my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java, applied to a real-world-style scenario.  
Users can register, issue books, return them, and view library records — all through a clean and simple console interface.

---

## 📌 Description

This is a **console-based mini system** that simulates a simple library.  
It uses Java OOP principles to manage:

- Books
- Users
- Issuing & Returning books

Each class handles its own responsibilities, making it clean, modular, and ready for upgrades (maybe a full-stack version someday? 👀).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool / Tech     | Purpose                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Java            | Core programming language           |
| IntelliJ IDEA   | IDE used for coding and testing     |
| Git & GitHub    | Version control and repo hosting    |
| OOP Concepts    | Class-based architecture            |
| Scanner class   | For console input handling (if extended) |

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ **Book Management**
  - Add new books to library
  - Display available and issued books

- ✅ **User Management**
  - Register new users
  - Track books issued by each user

- ✅ **Book Issuing System**

### 📃 Notes

- Uses **ArrayList** to manage collections of books and users  
- Follows **OOP best practices**: classes for each entity, modular responsibilities  
- Ready for future features like **GUI**, **database integration**, or **REST APIs**  
- Developed as a **task for internship at Elevate Labs**
